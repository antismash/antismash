antiSMASH - the antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis SHell
===================================================================

This repository is used to port antiSMASH to be compatible with Python 3, along
with mayor restructuring and code cleanup efforts. It is not feature-compatible
with previous antiSMASH versions for now, and certainly is not
production-quality code.

Development & Funding
---------------------

The development of antiSMASH was started as a collaboration of the Department of
Microbial Physiology and Groningen Bioinformatics Centre of the University of
Groningen, the Department of Microbiology of the University of Tübingen, and the
Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at the University of
California, San Francisco.  With the move of the PIs and developers, development
continues now at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, the Bioinformatics
Group at Wageningen University and The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for
Biosustainability in Lyngby.

antiSMASH development was/is supported by the GenBiotics program of the Dutch
Technology Foundation (STW), which is the applied-science division of The
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Technology
Programme of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (grant STW 10463), GenBioCom
program of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) grant 0315585A,
the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
